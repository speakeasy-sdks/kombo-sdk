# GetAtsJobsSuccessfulResponseDataResultsScreeningQuestionsFormat9Type

When we're not able to map a specific question type yet, we will return this type. Every `UNKNOWN` question will also be parsed and unified by us at some point. This is just a temporary workaround so you still get all questions.


## Values

| Name      | Value     |
| --------- | --------- |
| `UNKNOWN` | UNKNOWN   |

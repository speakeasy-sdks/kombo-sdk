# Visibility

Describes the visibility of the job:

- `PUBLIC`: visible to everyone, published on a job board
- `INTERNAL`: only visible to employees of the company itself
- `UNLISTED`: anyone can apply but only if they have the link to it
- `CONFIDENTIAL`: nobody can apply and it's only visible in the ATS to people who were invited to it

Useful if you are providing a job board and want to post public open jobs of your customers/partners.
